## Abstract Data Types

Here is an outline of the abstract data type (ADT) basic operations for popular data structures presented in a table format:

| Data Structure  | Basic Operations                                      |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Array           | - Accessing elements by index                         |
|                 | - Modifying elements by index                         |
|                 | - Inserting elements at the end (if dynamic)          |
|                 | - Deleting elements by index                          |
| Linked List     | - Insertion at head                                   |
|                 | - Insertion at tail                                   |
|                 | - Insertion at specific position                      |
|                 | - Deletion at head                                    |
|                 | - Deletion at tail                                    |
|                 | - Deletion at specific position                       |
| Stack           | - Push (adding an element to the top)                 |
|                 | - Pop (removing the top element)                      |
|                 | - Peek (viewing the top element without removal)      |
| Queue           | - Enqueue (adding an element to the rear)             |
|                 | - Dequeue (removing an element from the front)         |
|                 | - Front (viewing the element at the front)            |
|                 | - Rear (viewing the element at the rear)              |
| Binary Tree     | - Insertion                                           |
|                 | - Deletion                                            |
|                 | - Searching                                           |
|                 | - Depth-First Traversal (pre-order, in-order, post-order) |
|                 | - Breadth-First Traversal                             |
| Hash Table      | - Insertion                                           |
|                 | - Deletion                                            |
|                 | - Searching                                           |
|                 | - Accessing                                           |
|                 | - Collision handling (chaining, open addressing)      |
|                 | - Resizing (dynamic resizing of underlying array)     |
| Graph           | - Adding a vertex                                     |
|                 | - Removing a vertex                                   |
|                 | - Adding an edge                                      |
|                 | - Removing an edge                                    |
|                 | - Traversal (DFS, BFS)                                |
|                 | - Shortest path algorithms (Dijkstra's, Bellman-Ford) |
|                 | - Minimum Spanning Tree (Prim's, Kruskal's)           |

Each data structure has specific operations tailored to its characteristics and use cases. These operations are fundamental for manipulating and interacting with the data stored in the respective data structure.
